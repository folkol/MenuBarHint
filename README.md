# MenuBarHint

Simple macOS Menu Bar Widget that lists filenames found in `~/Library/Containers/com.folkol.MenuBarHint/Data/Library/Application\ Support/MenuBarHint/`.

(My main use case of this is writing small reminders as files, and remove them when done.)

I've added the app as a login item.

Quit it with `killall MenuBarHint`.

## TODO

- sort the items
- add a simple way to copy the 'hot folder path'
- add some GUI-way to quit the app
